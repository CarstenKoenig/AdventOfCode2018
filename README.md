# Advent of Code 2018

these are my solution to this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) as always probably mainly in Haskell.

all problems together run in under 15s

Overall this was fun but not as great as the last few years. The problems where sometimes 
a bit to tedious and long for my taste but I like that they are solvable even if people don't
know much about algorithms - as always I learned quite a bit by doing them.

Now I'm a bit sad that now there is no fun task waiting for me next morning :(

Thank you @topaz and all who helped.
