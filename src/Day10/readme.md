# Day 10

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/10).

nice litte exercise

to be honest outputing the image was the difficult part

for the algorith I just step the input and look at the maximum distance
of y-coordinates

Once they reach their first local minimum I stop (the idea is that I hope the points will end up
in a minmal "line")

That works for both the test and my input.
