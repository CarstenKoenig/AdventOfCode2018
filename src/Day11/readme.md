# Day 11

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/11).

todays problem asks us to find a maximum square of powerlevels

part 2 has some intersting options to optimize the calculation

---

UPDATE: I missed a rather obvious optimization technique - using a [Summed-area table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table)
approach brings back the time to 1/10th - which is fine for me as it's under my 5s goal.
