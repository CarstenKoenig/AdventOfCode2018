# Day 14

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/14).

the problem today is not really hard but I did not find a good solution for Haskell yet.

Right now I'm using `Data.Sequence` for the steps and it takes around 15s.

The alternate C# solution is not only shorter but also done in an eye-blink ... very sad :(
