# Day 15

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/15).

Todays puzzle was not to bad if you already have an A* or Dijkstras Implementation,
but it was rather tedious (took quite some time to model everything).

I made some smaller mistakes on the way but overall it was straight forward to do.

For part 2 the only optimization I did was to abandon a state as soon as the first
Elf dies.

It's still < 5s on my system which is ok with me.
