# Day 17

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/17).

todays puzzle itself was not too bad. Sadly I had a stupid mistake bug (I did not realize that
my algorithm goes up again and so can end up at a point where another branch went before)

Aside from this part 2 was really easy (just filter more)
