# Day 18

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/18).

again a day with a cellular automata where we are asked to look for a cycle.
Was not to bad but it's a bit of trial and error.

For my example looking for the first cycle after 500 iterations yielded the correct answer - you might need more though
