# Day 19

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/19).

again one of those days where we are asked to stare at opcodes and figure out the algorithm.

I'm split on that problems - they are great puzzlers but the main difficulty for me seems to be to
correctly find out the constants involved.

Here I messed this up - so I did output the registers at the outer loop to find it.

After this it's rewriting stuff till you find out that it is actually summing up the
factors of your big constant in two loops.

So more or less the same as last years problem.

My program will **not** work for anybody because you have to find out your own constant first (sorry).
