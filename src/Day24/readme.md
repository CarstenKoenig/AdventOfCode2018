# Day 24 - Immune System Simulator 20XX

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/24).

mainly a modeling problem - I have to admit that this one might have been easier
in OO style but it was not bad.

What did cost me quite some time was, that I messed up the order of attack-selection.
Was just to stupid to notice a missing `Down`.
After that part 2 was a piece of cacke.

Overall a nice one but I wish the creators would not choose easy but involved problems
for the 24th - I have other tasks today as well `:| - the last years where much more
enjoyable in that regards.
