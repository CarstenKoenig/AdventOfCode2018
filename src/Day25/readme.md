# Day 25 - Four-Dimensional Adventure

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/25).

this was a nice one again - it's basically asking us to find all connected
sub-sets of a graph and count those (the nodes are stars and the connections
are given by distance <= 3, the groups are constellations :D)
