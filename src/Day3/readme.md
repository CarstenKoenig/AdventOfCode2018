# Day 3

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3).

The puzzle is giving axis-parallel areas on a simple 2D plane and is asking us to find the area of overlapp.
The second part is about finding the one claim that is not overlapping anything.

I solved this by simply marking coordinates with the numbers of claims including it.
