# Day 4

the puzzle for today can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4).

The puzzle today is more about parsing and aggregating events.
I found this pretty lame and in hindsight it might have been a good idea
to write this into a Database and use the inbuild features instead.

It gives you a list with event telling you times when a guard
entered dutiy, fell asleep or woke up.

Part 1 asks you to you to find the guard sleeping the highest total timespan and the minute at
which he/she was asleep the most.

Part 2 aks you to find a guard that was asleep at a certain minute the most and the best minute for that.
